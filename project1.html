        <p class="username">MY ADMIRATION FOR THE FORMER US PRESIDENT</p>
        <P class="username">Barack Obama, the 44th president of the United States, was the first Black commander-in-chief. He was born on August 4, 1961, in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Barack Obama Sr. from Kenya and Ann Dunham from Kansas. Obama graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he was president of the Harvard Law Review. After serving on the Illinois State Senate, he was elected as a U.S. senator representing Illinois in 2004.

            In 2009, Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. He and his wife, Michelle Obama, have two daughters, Malia and Sasha. Obama's parents had diverse backgrounds; his father, Barack Obama Sr., was born in Kenya and his mother, Ann Dunham, was born in Kansas. Obama's multicultural upbringing and family background have played a significant role in shaping his personal and political identity.
